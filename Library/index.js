// !!Important --------------------------------------------------

// go through prototype object tutorial in js bootcamp to know How book argument is passing in function of display method

// --------------------------------------------------------------

// Adding methods in Display constructor

// The first method is add method which we are inserting in Display constructor lies on line no. 14

// !Important = When we click on button to submit, the event will fire and in that event we have described in if statment that if validate function will return true call the add function method which is the property of Display constructor 

// And by this the add function method will do its job of pushing the book object in localstorage and calling the another function showBooks to do their job simultaneously

// here we are receiving the book object variable in function parameter

    // console.log(bookObj)
    localStorage.setItem('notes', JSON.stringify(bookObj));
    // console.log(getBooks);
    // console.log(bookObj);
    // The reason of calling this function here because the notes in localstorage is not updated in the start we put this function after when notes in localstorage in updated

    // !Important - As per rule the function will not work untill we call that function that is why we put this function here so that firstly the upper methods of this function will do its job then we call this function to perform the tasks which is defined in showBooks function
    showBooks();


}

// The second function method is clear method which we are inserting in Display constructor lies on line no. 14

    // Grabbing the form using its id
    let libraryForm = document.getElementById('libraryForm');
    // And using the reset property to clear the form after click

}

// Here we are creating validate method function for display construtor

// Here book is an object in this function which is stored in book variable that is why we are using book.name and book.author in if-else statement

// If we have any button in form the default behaviour of that button is to submit the form instantly, to prevent that behaviour we use preventDefault function which is the property of e object in event listener
